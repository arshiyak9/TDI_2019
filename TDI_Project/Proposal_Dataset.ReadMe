This is a readme file for Acoustic Dataset for TDI2019 Challenge.
The dataset was developed using SOX in two tones- singletone and tritone. We have taken 10 samples of each tone.
".dat" files in this folder have readings of the amplitude of the dataset which was then converted to csv files to use in the dataset.
There are 2000 values of amplitudes for a quarter of a second.
